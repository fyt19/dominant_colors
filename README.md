# Dominant Colors

This project is a Python script that analyzes the colors in an image and shows the most dominant ones in a pie chart.

## How to run

## To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

## bash
```
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
Then, you need to have an image file named “image.jpg” in the same folder as the script. You can change the name of the file or the path in the code if you want.

To run the script, simply execute:
```
python dominant_colors.py
```
You should see a figure with two subplots: one showing the original image and one showing the dominant colors in a pie chart.
